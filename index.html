        <h2>HTML</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The head element contains information about the webpage.</li>
          <li>The body element represents the visible content shown to the user.</li>
          <li>Indentation and formatting: Maintain consistent indentation and use proper formatting to enhance code readability.</li>
          <li>Optimize images: Resize and compress images to improve webpage loading speed.</li>
          <li>Test your website: Ensure your webpage displays correctly on different browsers and devices.</li>

      <section class="card" id="css-section">
        <h2>CSS</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A margin indicates how much space we want around the outside of an element.</li>
          <li>A padding indicates how much space we want around the content inside an element.</li>
          <li>Assigning colors in CSS can be done in many ways, including by semantic references such as gray or blue. We can also refer to a color by its hexadecimal code, or hex #.</li>
          <li>Class attributes allow us to share a CSS rule to any element we choose by assigning the rule to a class attribute with a class selector.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="git-section">
        <h2>Git</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
          <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
          <li>A branch is a copy or version of the code that can be worked on independently in isolation so development changes do not disrupt other team members who are also working on the code and testing their solutions. </li>
          <li>Create a pull request to ask collaborators for feedback on your changes.</li>
          <li>Remember that we use Git in our local development environment to enable version control.</li>
          <li>GitHub offers a task management tool called GitHub issues, which gives developers and teams an easy way to keep track of key tasks and progress.</li>
        </ul>

      <section class="card" id="javascript-section">
        <h2>JavaScript</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>A variable is a named container that allows us to store data in our code.</li>
          <li>Control flow is the order in which a computer executes code in a script.</li>
          <li>A function's name is followed by parentheses ().</li>
          <li>A function is different from a for loop or conditional statement because functions do not automatically execute when the JavaScript file (in our case, script.js) is run</li>
          <li>Arrays are useful tools for storing multiple items with different data types in a single variable, but not all arrays must have multiple data types.</li>
